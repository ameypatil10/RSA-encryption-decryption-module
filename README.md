# RSA-encryption-decryption-module
RSA encryption-decryption algorithm from scratch in C++ built upon low level supporting functions  in Big Integer class efficiently

Functions implemented

1. Modulo addition, Multiplication and Exponentiation
2. GCD and inverse Modulo n.
3. Discrete logarithm (using either Pohlig-Hellman, index calculus, Pollard-rho or the basic Baby Step Giant Step algorithm)
4. RSA Key generation
5. RSA encryption
6. RSA decryption
7. Field Operations in Prime Fields and Binary Fields.
